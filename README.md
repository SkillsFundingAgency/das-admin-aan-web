This web solution is part of Apprentice Ambassador Network (AAN) project. AAN requires admin users to create and manage events which are organised by the ambassadors. Also there is a need to manage ambassadors (members). These two journies are enabled in this solution. 

## How It Works

The web module uses default landing dashboard on admin portal [das-admin-service](https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency/das-admin-service). 

There are two types of admin users, pure admin users who mainly manage events and then there are regional chairs who can also manage ambassadors. The users have to have a working DFE Sign-in to authenticate and they should have at least one of the following claims: 
- AMM Manage members role
- AME Manage events role
